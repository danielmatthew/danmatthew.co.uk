As CSS evolves it brings with it more nuanced selectors to help us target elements in documents that increase in complexity.

## Pseudo-classes
### :root pseudo-class
`:root` represents an element that is at the root of the document. Typically, this will be the `html` element.

### :nth-child pseudo-class
`:nth-child`
