Did you know Bitcoin (BTC) now consumes more energy than Argentina, and only slightly less than Norway, per [Cambridge University's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index](https://cbeci.org/cbeci/comparisons)? I bought in at the start of January, after it hit $40,000. This is somewhat of a contrast to my wish to invest in "green" technologies. I feel grubby, and that feeling isn't helped by the manner in which the value is easily manipulated by Papa Elon and co.
